# Random Walker Simulation

This is a Python program that simulates the movement of a random walker on a canvas using the Tkinter library.

## Description

The program creates a window with a canvas where a walker starts at the center. The walker moves randomly in four directions (up, down, left, right) with each step. The movement is visualized by drawing points on the canvas.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library
  
## Usage

Run the program:
The simulation window will open, and you'll see the random walker moving on the canvas.
